    <h1>About Andy Hovey</h1>
    <p>I’m a design and product leader from Aotearoa New Zealand. I’ve been working on digital products and services for over 15 years. I use design research, with a focus on how people act over what they say, and interaction design to help organisations work out which problems to solve and how to solve them.</p>
    <p>I believe complex challenges are best tackled by multi-disciplinary teams. I collaborate with folks ranging from scientists to business leaders and subject matter experts to end users to build elegant software that helps people meet their goals.</p>
    <p>Since August 2019 I’ve been working with the intimidatingly intelligent and friendly people at <a href='https://www.xerra.nz/'>Xerra</a> Earth Observation Institute. I’m the Head of Product and Design there. We’re building tools to helps us understand activity in Aotearoa’s maritime domain, amongst other projects.</p>
    <p>From 2016 – 2019 I explored some of the world’s great mountain ranges on bicycle and foot. Very fortunate I know. Photos of mountains, like the one below, can be seen on <a href ='https://www.instagram.com/andyhovey/'>instagram.com</a>. I also make a cycle touring related product over at <a href='https://waywardriders.com/'>waywardriders.com</a>.</p>

    <p>Prior to cycling touring I was the Head of Design at <a href='https://www.xero.com/'>Xero.com</a>, working on small business software used by millions of people around the world.</p>
    <p>In previous roles I’ve worked on websites and apps for the New Zealand Red Cross, Klim Type Foundry, Kiwibank, New Zealand Arts Festival, Amazon and many others. More work history (and birthday notifications from people you don’t know) can be found on <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewhovey/'>Linkedin.com</a>.</p>
