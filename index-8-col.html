        <h2>Product strategy and design from Aotearoa New Zealand.</h2>
        <p>I use design research and interaction design to help organisations work out which problems to solve and how to solve them. I believe complex challenges are best tackled by collaborative, multidisciplinary teams.</p>
        <p>Since August 2019 I’ve been working with the inspiring team of scientists, engineers and communication experts at <a href='https://www.xerra.nz/'>Xerra</a> Earth Observation Institute. We’re building powerful, elegant software to help us monitor and protect Aotearoa’s maritime domain, amongst other projects focused on improving our natural environment. </p>
        <p>In previous design leadership roles I’ve worked on websites and apps for Xero.com, New Zealand Red Cross, Klim Type Foundary, Kiwibank, New Zealand Arts Festival, Amazon and many others.</p>

     <p>From 2016 – 2019 I explored some of the world’s great mountain ranges on bicycle and foot. Very fortunate I know. Photos of mountains, like the one below, can be seen on <a href ='https://www.instagram.com/andyhovey/'>instagram.com</a>. I also make a cycle touring related product over at <a href='https://waywardriders.com/'>waywardriders.com</a>.</p>
